Notes-

Distance Vector:-
The table class has field routingTable, which consists of a map<unsigned, map<unsigned, double> >. 
The inner maps are distance vectors, where the index is the destination node and the value is 
the minimum latency to the destination node. The outter map's index represents the source node
and the value of the index is the source node's distance vector (the inner map). Every node has 
a copy of the routingTable. Currently, our nodes are able to communicate and build their own tables
correctly. However, GetNextHop works only on some occasions. 


Link State:-
The table class includes a field called the linkTable. Each node has a copy of the linkTable. The linkTable is a 2D table formed by
a map of maps. The outermost map has key-value pairs such that the key is the node number (we call this the "from" node) and the value is a map of its neighbours.
The inner map has key-value pairs such that the key is the "to" node number and the value is the latency of the link from the "from" node to the "to" node.
The linkTable stores all the links in the topology. 
In GetNextHop, we perform djikstas algorithm on these links to find the shortest path and return the next node on the current path.
